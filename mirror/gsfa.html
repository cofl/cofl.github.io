From there:</p><blockquote><p>In late 2006, Gary Shannon posted a list of over 800 example sentences from the book 1200 Graded Sentences for Analysis. Because his website was down for an extended period of time, I archived the Graded Sentences here. [...] Gary&apos;s site is still the official home for the GSFA list.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, the &quot;I&quot; does not refer to me, but seeing as Gary&apos;s site has been totally replaced, the original mirror hasn&apos;t been updated since 2008, and it&apos;s a tad annoying to have to download 5 separate text files, here&apos;s the list combined. For a list of all words used in these sentences, I still refer you to the original site.</p><ol><li>Birds sing.</li><li>Children play.</li><li>Dogs bark.</li><li>Bees hum.</li><li>Baby
