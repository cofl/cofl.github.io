## Acknowledgements
This paper would not have been possible without the invitation of the Anaretian Directory and prompting from my professor, Jian Stenberg, of the University of Valles Marineris. I'd also like to extend my most sincere gratitude to the students and faculty of both Onizue Academy and Lanhalennin Suorikät, as well as the people of Ennanö, Lanhalen, and the entire Tyyvä region for their cooperation with my research, and for all the source materials they provided for my further education. Lastly, I want to thank my guide and friend, Keliäristä Sonora, who has been extremely patient with me during my time on Anaret, and has always been willing to assist me in any way.

## a. Conventions

This document makes use of a few conventions:

- Forward slashes (//) are used around [phonemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme).  
  These are the recognized distinct sounds found in a language. This format is called __broad transcription__.
- Square brackets ([]) are used around [phones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(linguistics)).   
  These sounds are absolutes, many of which may be covered by a single phoneme. This format is called __narrow transcription__.
- Single chevrons (&lsaquo;&rsaquo;) are used around [graphemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme).  
  These symbols are used to write down language. They may or may not correlate to phonemes. Please note that single chevrons are not the standard punctuation for this, but are similarly visually and are more visually appealing than some other angle brackets.

Some further conventions are used to label affixes:

 - Suffixes are marked with a preceding hyphen, e.g. -*suff.*
 - Prefixes are marked with a trailing hypen, e.g. *pref.*-
