    <li>We visited my uncle's village, the largest village in the world.</li>
    <li>We learn something new each day.</li>
    <li>The market begins five minutes earlier this week.</li>
    <li>Did you find the distance too great?</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Hurry, children.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Madam, I will obey your command.</li>

      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Think first and then act.</li>
    <li>I stood, a little mite of a girl, upon a chair by the window, and watched the falling snowflakes.</li>
    <li>

    <li>I shall lend you the books that you need.</li>
    <li>Come early next Monif you can.</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>If you come early, wait in the hall.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>I had a younger brother whose name was Antonio.</li>
    <li>Gnomes are little men who live under the ground.</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>He is loved by everybody, because he has a gentle disposition.</li>

    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>That is the funniest story I ever heard.</li>

    <li>They are no wiser than we.</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Light travels faster than sound.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>When the wind blew, the traveler wrapped his mantle more closely around him.</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>I am sure that we can go.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We went back to the place where we saw the roses.</li>
    <li>&quot;This tree is fifty feet high,&quot; said the gardener.</li>
    <li>I think that this train leaves five minutes earlier today.</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>My opinion is that the governor will grant him a pardon.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Why he has left the city is a mystery.</li>
    <li>The house stands where three roads meet.</li>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>He has far more money than brains.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Evidently that gate is never opened, for the long grass and the great hemlocks grow close against it.</li>
    <li>I met a little cottage girl; she was eight years old, she said.</li>
