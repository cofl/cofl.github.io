# <a name="top"></a>Caållghia (/kˠɔɫɣʲə/)

Caållghià was inspired by the Irish phonology, ish. The spelling is somewhat broken right now.

## Consonants

- /n/ is /ɲ/ before front unrounded vowels.  
- Broad consonants are often followed by a velar offglide when in front of front vowels  
- Broad consonants are often followed by a short aspirated [ə] at the end of words.  
- Thin consonants are often followed by a palatal offglide when in front of back vowels.  
- Thin consonants are often followed by an unreleased /j/ at the end of words.  
- Consonant clusters almost always agree in series.

- When adjacent to nasal consonants, vowels become nasalized, the degree depending on how far back the consonant is, with /m/ causing almost no nasalization and /ɴ/ causing a great deal. Vowels are also slightly nasalized after /ɣ/.  
- Vowels always agree in series with the consonant coming before them.  
- Vowel clusters almost always agree in series.
- /ɐ o ɘ/ become /ə/ word-finally.

## Orthography.

No idea what I'm doing here. I know the base glyphs more or less line up with the IPA, except &lt;c> for /k/. Lenited consonants are indicated with &lt;h>. Broad consonants are denoted by &lt;a> or &lt;o>, and slender consonants are denoted by &lt;i> or &lt;e>, depending on various aesthetic rules I don't quite know.

# Syntax and Stuff

I'd like to go with SOV, head-final with suffixing locational cases, with the core cases being indicated by a vowel change stemming from ablaut. Unergative verbs will be common.
