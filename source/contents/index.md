# cofl's stuff
<!--{#top.center}-->

This page serves as a jumping-point for my resources and such. Please use the navigation sidebar to ease finding things. `Ctrl-F` works, too. Some pages may be broken, as I reworked the site structure and may have missed changing a few things.

- [__Blog__](/blog/)  
  I have one of these. There's not much on it. You should read it, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing.

- [__root__](/directory.html)
  The index of this site. Use it to find things if they're not linked here!

## Tools

- [__Glossifier Glossing Formatting Assistant__](/tools/autoformatter.html)  
  A while back, headerless tables were introduced on [/r/conlangs](http://reddit.com/r/conlangs). I took a liking to them, but the formatting was hell, so I made this tool to translate an easier source into reddit markdown.

## Games

This is a list of games I've run over on [/r/conlangs](http://reddit.com/r/conlangs).

- __[Syntax Testing](/conlang/resources/games/syntax-testing.html)__  
  Adapted from [Fiziwig's Conlang Syntax Test Cases List][fiziwigcases]. The point of these challenges was to develop syntax by exploring many possible cases. Fiziwig's list itself was adapted from a longer source, but cut out many duplicates.
- __[Concepts](/conlang/resources/games/concepts.html)__  
  Adapted from Helen S. Eaton's *Semantic Frequency List* (1940).

## Mirror

There are a few things that are available elsewhere, but I keep copies of them here.

- __[Graded Sentences for Analysis](/conlang/resources/mirror/graded-sentences-for-analysis.html)__  
  An all-in-one rehost of the text files from <http://www.potterpcs.net/gsfa/>, which are themselves a mirror of files no longer available.
- __[Conlang Syntax Test Cases](/conlang/resources/mirror/conlang-syntax-test-cases.html)__  
  A mirror of the [Fiziwig list][fiziwigcases], on which the Syntax Testing game was based.

## Conlangs
### Saadan Languages
The Saadan Languages were the very first languages I ever created. In reality, they were the evolutions and restarts of the original, Plû'ua'sv'dÿner, which was a nooblang inspired into creation by Nreku, a conlang I'd found and met the creator of on a writer's chatroom. I wouldn't be where I was today without them.

For more information, see the [Saadan Languages directory page](/conlang/named/saadan/).

### Sketches

### Sketches and one-off documents
Most of these occurred around when or after work stopped on the Saadan languages. Ultimately, they majority of them have been abandoned. My latest sketches and documents can be found at the [Sketches directory page](/conlang/sketches/)
