# Saadan Languages
<!--{#top.center}-->
The Saadan Languages were the very first languages I ever created. In reality, they were the evolutions and restarts of the original, Plû'ua'sv'dÿner, which was a nooblang inspired into creation by Nreku, a conlang I'd found and met the creator of on a writer's chatroom. I wouldn't be where I was today without them.

## Naretvei
Naretvei was the last of the major revisions before I abondoned the family. Documentation began in early 2015 for an English assignment. This documentation exists in two versions, neither of which is particularly better than the other. Version 0 I find has more info on the actual grammar, while Version 1 has conworld notes not found in Version 0.

### Version 0
- [Reference Grammar](naretvei/00/index.html)
- [Text Samples](naretvei/00/text-samples.html)
- [Syntax Testing](naretvei/00/graded-sentences-for-analysis.html)

### Version 1
- [Reference Grammar](naretvei/1/reference.html)

## Naretsov
Naretsov was *the* last revision, stemming from the work on Naretvei. It never got past a sketch and a few example sentences, but it does have what I think of as an interesting lexicon page.
- [Sketch](naretsov/sketch.html)
- [Syntax Testing](naretsov/gsfa.html)
- [Examples](naretsov/examples.html)
- [Lexicon (beta)](naretsov/lexicon/)
