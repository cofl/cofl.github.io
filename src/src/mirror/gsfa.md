# <a name="top">Graded Sentences for Analysis</a>

This list is an all-in-one mirror of the lists on <http://www.potterpcs.net/gsfa/>. From there:

> In late 2006, Gary Shannon posted a list of over 800 example sentences from the book 1200 Graded Sentences for Analysis. Because his website was down for an extended period of time, I archived the Graded Sentences here. [...] Gary's site is still the official home for the GSFA list.

Obviously, the "I" does not refer to me, but seeing as Gary's site has been totally replaced, the original mirror hasn't been updated since 2008, and it's a tad annoying to have to download 5 separate text files, here's the list combined. For a list of all words used in these sentences, I still refer you to the original site.
