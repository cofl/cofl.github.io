### Class Features

As an Incanter, you gain the following class features.

Incanting
: Something about magic just clicks for you.
: Incantations are a form of spellcasting rooted in simple magic. They have
  several possible effects and may be used multiple times, though each effect
  requires different resources, including time, and thus may not be usable again
  until after one or more short or long rests (depending on the effect). You know
  all of the effects of all of the incantations that you have the prerequisite
  requirements for.
: When you learn a new incantation, you may additionally swap one of your
  already-known incantations out for another.

Cant
: At 1st level, you may choose a Cant. Cants grant unique abilities as you gain
  further levels beyond 1st level.

Spell Slots
: The Incanter table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows
  what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.
  Some of your incantations require you to expend a spell slot. You regain all
  expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when
  you are 5th level, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. Each incantation
  requiring a spell slot lists its effects when cast with a certain-level spell
  slot.
: Incantation effects with the Cantrip tag

Ritual Incanting
: You may cast any incantation effect you know as a ritual if that incantation
  effect has the ritual tag and is eligible to be cast, including spell slot
  availability. For example, if you were to cast an incantation effect requiring
  a spell slot, but you have used all of your spell slots, you may not cast that
  incantation effect as a ritual.
