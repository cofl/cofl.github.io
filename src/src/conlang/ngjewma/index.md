## <a name="1">1</a>. Introduction
The Ngjewma language was begun in June 2015 as a phonology to explore the concept of fortis and lenis consonants, and as a semi-reimagining of Njema.

The language features a Object-Verb sentence order, which was decided upon as the most viable after considering the use of Verb-Subject-Object sentence order like my Naretvei/Saadan/Savidenec language(s), though the strict head-finality quickly changed my mind. As for the Subject, by default it tends to be at the front of the sentence, though it like all arguments may appear in any position it wishes if the meaning isn't made unclear. I intend for it to be primarily synthetic with a handful of cases, as in my Njema language, but lacking the complex verb conjugations and grammatical genders of that language in favour of a more simplified approach. In the conworld that it's a part of, it is a minority language in the same area as Njema, and is a distant relative of that language, though the split is long before the realization of the Hyzé-Kannomo language family that Njema is apart of.

## <a name="2">2</a>. Phonology
As stated above, the Ngjewma phonology was created to explore a more strict fortis-lenis distinction in the plosive consonants, which became the voiced-voiceless "weak" consonants (lenis) and the aspirated voiceless "strong" consonants (fortis). It also evolved from the remnants of Njema phonology, and from Japanese. The language distinguishes between consonants in the onset and coda, so coda consonants will be listed as a separate series.

<b><sup>1</sup>:</b> Not actually Velar or Bilabial, they just make the chart look nice.

In addition to the above, there are two more coda consonants: Q and N. Q is used to geminate the following consonant, and N is used to insert a nasal (/m/, /n/, or /ŋ/) that assimilates to the position of the following consonant. Both default to /ɴ/, the uvular nasal.

There are several sound changes that occur between consonants:

 - /ɣj/ often becomes [ʝ]
 - /ɣ/ often becomes /g/ after N.

### <a name="2.2">2.2</a> Vowels

The vowel system is much simpler, though still has a few tricks up its sleeve. As with the charts above, some liberties are being taken on technical positioning to produce a concise chart.

<table class="tb-pair tb-center tr-headers">
  <thead><tr><th>Romanization</th>
    <th>Front</th>
    <th>Back</th>
    <th>Deep Back<sup>1</sup></th></tr></thead>
  <tr><td>High</td>
    <td>&lt;i&gt; &lt;ii&gt;</td>
    <td colspan="2">&lt;u&gt; &lt;uu&gt;</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mid</td>
    <td>&lt;e&gt; &lt;ee&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;o&gt; &lt;oo&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;ò&gt; &lt;òò&gt;</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Low</td>
    <td colspan="2">&lt;a&gt; &lt;aa&gt;</td>
    <td>&lt;à&gt; &lt;àà&gt;</td></tr></table>

 - A simple vowel harmony exists that contrasts the back and deep back vowels, though this harmony is often broken when combining roots.
 - /ɯ/ and /i/ may become voiceless or dropped syllable-finally.
 - Several vowels when in combination change. These are:
   - /ɤɯ/→/ɤː/
   - /ʌɯ/→[əɯ]
   - /ʌɑ/→/ʌː/
   - /ɑʌ/→/ɑː/
 - All vowels, especially deep back vowels, often become nasalized preceding N.

### <a name="2.3">2.3</a> Other sound rules

#### Palatalization
Before /i/, /iː/, or /j/ (where /j/ is elided):

 - /s/ → /ɕ/
 - /tʰ/ → /tɕʰ/
 - /z/ → /ʑ/
 - /d̥~d/ → /dʑ/

#### Softening
Before /ɯ/, /ɯː/, or /ɯᵝ/ (where /ɯᵝ/ is elided):

 - /b̥~b/ → /b~β/
 - /tʰ/ → /tsʰ/
 - /d̥~d/ → /dz/

Before /ɑ/ or /ʌ/:

 - /pʰ/ → /px/
 - /tʰ/ → /tx/
 - /kʰ/ → /kx/ or /xː/

#### Other

 - Weak plosives and fricatives become strong and voiced when starting non-initial combining morphemes, with the exception of /ɣ/, which becomes /j/. See [wiki/Rendaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendaku) for the inspiration of this effect in Japanese.

### <a name="2.4">2.4</a> Syllable Structure
The syllables of Ngjewma follow a strict Consonant-Approximant-Vowel-Approximant-Terminal structure. The onset consonant may be any weak or strong consonant (this means no finals, Q, or N). An approximant is any approximant, but the medial approximant may not be present if the onset consonant is a weak nasal. A vowel is any vowel, and a terminal is any final consonant, Q, or N.

Q may also appear as the first consonant of a suffix, indicating gemination of the previous consonant.
