This page serves as a jumping-point for my resources and such. Please use the navigation sidebar to ease finding things. `Ctrl-F` works, too. Some pages may be broken, as I reworked the site structure and may have missed changing a few things.

## Tools

- [__Glossifier Glossing Formatting Assistant__](/tools/autoformatter.html)  
  A while back, headerless tables were introduced on [/r/conlangs](http://reddit.com/r/conlangs). I took a liking to them, but the formatting was hell, so I made this tool to translate an easier source into reddit markdown.

## Games

This is a list of games I've run over on [/r/conlangs](http://reddit.com/r/conlangs).

- __[Syntax Testing](/challenges/Syntax_Testing.html)__  
  Adapted from [Fiziwig's Conlang Syntax Test Cases List](https://web.archive.org/web/20130603121930/http://fiziwig.com/conlang/syntax_tests.html). The point of these challenges was to develop syntax by exploring many possible cases. Fiziwig's list itself was adapted from a longer source, but cut out many duplicates.
  
- __[Concepts](/challenges/Concepts.html)__  
  Adapted from Helen S. Eaton's *Semantic Frequency List* (1940).
